# Sahar's Portfolio ♡

## Overview

This is a website where the user can dive deep into what I have done over the past few years during my personal and professional journey. Users can search for and sort through my projects and gain in-depth knowledge of what I specifically accomplished. Moreover, the user can fill out a contact form so that when the form is submitted, their contact information will be stored in the database, which I can check. Lastly, this website will have interactions that reflect my interests such as design and art.

## Data Model

The application will store Contacts and Projects.

* contacts will be remembered
* projects will be used for searching

An Example Contact:

```javascript
{
